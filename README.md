# radseq_ficus_2019

This repo contains the pipeline and scripts used for the Rasplus et al paper on the deep phylogeny of Ficus spp based on RADseq

Pipeline and scripts are provided "as they are" for a Linux environment (they were written under Ubuntu 15.10, I know ... we have to upgrade our system !)

I am not a bioinformatician yet I am trying to do my best! So the code will not appear clean to purists (appologize for that) but it works (at least for me).

If you find something useful in there, please cite the publication :

Thanks !
