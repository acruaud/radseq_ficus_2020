# radseq_ficus_2020
 
 This repo contains the pipeline and scripts used for the Rasplus et al paper on the deep phylogeny of Ficus spp based on RADseq.
 
 Pipeline and scripts are provided "as they are".
 
When you download the repository you have access to two directories
 
 i) assembly_R1R2 that contains the pipeline used for the assembly of paired reads and the retrieval of RAD loci from genomes of outgroup species (radseq_ficus_assemblyR1R2.html). Required scripts are in the "scripts" directory.
 
 ii) PCA that contains i) the R workflow to perform PCA analysis to identify potential bias that could alter tree estimates, ii) example file.
